# ranna

ãƒ©ãƒ³ãƒŠãƒ¼ - Experimental code runner microservice based on Docker containers.

## âš  PLEASE READ BEFORE USE

First of all, this project is currently **work in progress** and not fully finished.  
Also, this service allows **arbitrary code execution in Docker containers**. This will be a high security risk! If you want to use this service, only use this on a separate, encapsulated server environment!

## ðŸš€ Setup

First of all, you need to know that ranna needs access to the docker socket. 
> This can be done over network, but currently, there is no network file provider implementation to push the source code files to the docker host system.

You can get the binary directly by compiling the source code.
```
$ go build -o ranna cmd/ranna/main.go
```

Or build tzhe provided Docker image.
```
$ docker build . -t ranna
```

But keep in mind, when you are using the Docker image, you need to pass the host's docker socket as volume to the container.
```
$ docker run --name ranna \
    -e RANNA_HOSTROOTDIR=/var/opt/ranna \
    -v /var/opt/ranna:/var/opt/ranna \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -p 8080:8080
    ranna
```

# ðŸ“¡ REST API

When the service is up, you can send an execution request as following:

```
> POST /v1/exec HTTP/
> Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{
  "language": "python3",
  "code": "print('Hello world!')"
}
```

And the response will look like following:

```
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Server: ranna
< Content-Type: application/json
< Content-Length: 39
```
```json
{
  "stdout": "Hello world!\n",
  "stderr": ""
}
```
